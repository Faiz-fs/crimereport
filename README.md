SYSTEM REQUIREMNETS

    • Operating System: Windows , Mac OS, Linux Kernal. (platform independent)
    • Processor: Dual Core 1.4GHz Processor 
    • RAM: Minimum 4 GB 
    • Hard Disk Space: Minimum 750MB space required.
    • Software: Python 3.7.0

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT

The main objective of the Online Crime Reporting System is to manage the details of Crime, Criminal, Public, Solutions, Department. It manages all the information about Crime, Complaint, Department, Crime. The project is totally built at user and administrator end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access and safety of the user who report crime.
The user can:
    • Report crime without their names
    • They can check the status of the crime reported by their own complaint number provided
    • They can view the crimes filed in the record which are solved  and not yet noticed
The administrator can:
    • View all the report which are reported by user
    • Update status of the crime 
    • Ensure the security and safety of the user in online
The source code contains different modules, built-in functions, user-defined functions, switch statements, loop statements, etc
All the details of crime ,complaints, and reports are stored in an CSV file with a separate table for each. The user is given a unique complaint number  in which he/she can view their status of crime report each time. The admin can easily update the status  and store details of crimes in CSV file .
Therefore, this project helps to maintain a security and simple interface for the user and administrator.

MODULES PURPOSES AND CODING

 Modules Used
    • flask
    • os
    • csv
    • time 
    • random
 Modules Purposes
    • flask : Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
    • os :It provides functions for interacting with the operating system. This  module 
provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
    • csv : It is  used to store a large number of variables – or data. They are incredibly simplified spreadsheets – think Excel – only the content is stored in plaintext.
    • time : It provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
    • random : It is a built-in module to generate the pseudo-random variables .

CONCLUSION

                  In this paper, a completely integrated and compact system is developed that can be used by the common man as well as the police and this system would be like a win-win situation for both of them. This project will be widely used in the future by the police department, the common man, security agencies and even hospitals (for accident and assault victims). The greatest strength of this project is that it offers new features as well as retaining the original characteristics of the existing systems(for example: Criminal Database).
